## New in v0.2

* Added PTH option for the 5V protection diode (BAT85 or another Schottky will work)
* Moved ESP module to the edge of the board, to get some additional clearance between the antenna and the ground plane
* Added silkscreen documentation to both sides of the board
* Rounded all the corners of the board (I had missed one in v0.1 :) )

## New in v0.3

* Increased size of silkscreen instructions (they were almost unreadable in previous versions)
* Moved screw terminals closer to the edge of the board, to make connection easier
* Corrected reversed OE and LS on the HUB75E connector
* Increased width of 5V power trace for ESP32
* Exposed debugging pins to dedicated header
* Rotated 2.1/5.5mm power jack to make the board fit in the case with the jack connected
* Added JTAG/PROG connectors for ESP32-prog programming and debugging

## TODO in v0.4

* Increase spacing around JTAG/PROG to allow for shrouded connectors
* Change diode SMD footprint to make it easier to solder?
