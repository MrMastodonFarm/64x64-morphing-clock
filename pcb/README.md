# ESP32 Morphing Clock Shield PCB

## Info

*WARNING!!* This has *not* been tested yet! 
I am still waiting for the finished boards to arrive, so I have not yet had the chance to test that the PCBs function properly. This is very early work (notice the "0.1" version) - use it at your own risk!

Features:
* 16-wire ribbon cable connection to the RGB matrix
* Mounting holes for securing the shield to the enclosure
* Options for both PTH and SMD (0805) parts for resistors and capacitors
* Multiple JST-XH (2.54mm) connectors for I2C sensors and for GPIOs (use for push-buttons, for example)
