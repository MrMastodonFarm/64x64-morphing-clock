#ESP32 Morphing Clock Case

This is a design for a case matching my model of RGB matrix.

You should be able to take this to your favorite laser cutting place, and ask them to cut it out of 3mm thick plexiglass (it has to be 3mm, otherwise you will need to adjust the size of the tabs!).

All the dimensions in the file are in mm, and the model has already been placed on a standard 450x600mm sheet of plexiglass.

As per my fab requirements, the red lines are for cutting, and the green lines are for line engraving. Everything else in the file is ignored.

*IMPORTANT!*
The exact dimensions of the matrix (the plastic frame, and the mounting screw holes) may vary - even for the same product, from the same vendor! Whenever possible, ask your matrix vendor for the technical drawings of the particular model you bought, and use the dimensions from those drawings to adjust the design!!
