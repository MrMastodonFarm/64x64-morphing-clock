# ESP32 Morphing Clock Case

## Intro

This is a design for a case matching my model of RGB matrix.

You should be able to take this to your favorite laser cutting place, and ask them to cut it out of 3mm thick plexiglass (it has to be 3mm, otherwise you will need to adjust the size of the tabs!).

All the dimensions in the file are in mm, and the model has already been placed on a standard 450x600mm sheet of plexiglass.

As per my fab requirements, the red lines are for cutting, and the green lines are for line engraving. Everything else in the file is ignored.

**IMPORTANT!**

The exact dimensions of the matrix (the plastic frame, and the mounting screw holes) may vary - even for the same product, from the same vendor! Whenever possible, ask your matrix vendor for the technical drawings of the particular model you bought, and use the dimensions from those drawings to adjust the design!!

## Features

* Holes for routing a 110V/230V power cable from the side
* Two power options - 5V via 5.5/2.1mm jack, or 110/230V with internally mounted 5V AC/DC power supply
* Holes on the back for mounting two types of 230V-to-5V AC/DC power supplies (optional)
* Cable holders for securely mounting the power cable to the side of the case (the small rectangular things with two screw holes each)
* Holes on the sides for panel-mount switches, push-buttons, and TSL2591 and TSL2561 light sensors
* Holes on the top for TSL2561/TSL2591 
* Holes on the back, top and bottom for mounting pot-type magnets for attaching it to metal supports
* Holes on the back for mounting a buzzer module
* Fits perfectly into an Ikea BOTKYRKA metal shelf (and since the shelf is made of metal, you can use the magnets to hold it securely)
